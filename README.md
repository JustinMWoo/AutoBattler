# AutoBattler

## Overview
This repo contains the code used in a fully functioning single player autobattler. The game begins with the player in a buying phase where they are able to purchase units from a selection of random ones for the upcoming battles. Each unit has a set and tribe attribute that provides bonuses to the team depending on how many of that particular set/tribe are present on the player's team. Additionally, if three of the same unit are present they will be replaced with a more powerful version of the unit. Following this phase a randomly generated map for the current game will be shown to the player where they can view the paths available to them and choose their next destination. In combat nodes on the map the player will be faced with an enemy board layout which they can position against before starting combat. The battle will play out automatically when the player's positions are finalized. Eventually the player will arrive at the final  node on the map where they will be put up against a more powerful foe and upon defeating said enemy they will proceed to the next stage (with a new map and more powerful enemies).
